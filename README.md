## System Analysis

### Existing System

In the existing manual system, timetables are prepared manually by the college management, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process. This system involves a significant amount of paperwork, and there is no guarantee of an optimal timetable. Dual allocation of the same teacher at the same time in different classes is a common issue, and modifying the timetable requires a complete reconstruction.

#### Disadvantages of the Existing System

- Time-consuming manual process.
- Prone to errors and redundancy in scheduling.
- Requires a significant amount of manpower and paperwork.
- Cannot detect dual allocation of teachers.
- Modifying the timetable is a complex and time-consuming task.
- Does not always satisfy the preferences of lecturers.

### Motivation for the Proposed System

The Timetable Management System aims to address the limitations of the existing manual system. It is designed to automate and optimize the timetable generation process, reduce paperwork, and provide flexibility for both administrators and lecturers.

### Proposed System

The proposed system automates the timetable generation process, reducing paperwork and solving the allocation challenges faced by the college. It offers flexibility, minimizes processing power, reduces the time needed to generate timetables, and simplifies the entire process. The system ensures transparency, security, and efficient management of the timetable.

#### Advantages of the Proposed System

- Increased flexibility compared to manual processes.
- Minimal computing power required.
- Faster timetable generation with minimal errors.
- Significant reduction in paperwork.
- Streamlined timetable management.
- Secure and tamper-proof timetable generation.
- Enhanced administrative control.
- Grievance management for lecturers.
- Downloadable timetables for users.
- Extended privileges for administrators.
